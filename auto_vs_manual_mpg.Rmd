## Introduction
The Motor Trend, a magazine about the automobile industry are interested in exploring the relationship between a set of variables and miles per gallon (MPG) (outcome). The data set of collection of cars (**mtcars**) is used for this study, The focus are particularly interested in the following two questions:

1. Is an automatic or manual transmission better for MPG
2. Quantify the MPG difference between automatic and manual transmissions

## Data Analysis & Exploratory
The dataset consist of `r dim(mtcars)[2]` and `r dim(mtcars)[1]` observation data. The detail description for each variable as per _Appendix A_. Now, let look on the dataset structure.
```{r}
str(mtcars)
```

Than, calculate the mean for both transmission type and plot the boxplot to visualized the pattern for both transmission types. _(refer Appendix B)_
```{r}
c(automatic = mean(mtcars[mtcars$am==0,]$mpg), manual = mean(mtcars[mtcars$am==1,]$mpg))
```

The result from mean calculation and boxplot shows that the automatic transmission is better than manual transmission in _mpg_ consumption. Let take that as our Null Hypothesis ( $H_0$). Now we test the $H_0$ with T-Test and the probability of Type 1 error is ($\alpha = 0.05$)

```{r}
hypo.result <- t.test(mtcars[mtcars$am==0,]$mpg, mtcars[mtcars$am==1,]$mpg)
hypo.result$p.value
```

However the hypothesis testing show that the _p-value_ < $\alpha$ which force us to reject the $H_0$.

## Regression Model

Firstly, let look at the linear model that corespond to our $H_0$._(Appendix D)_ 

```{r}
# factor variable am
mtcars$am <- as.factor(mtcars$am) 

#create a simple model
model.0 <- lm(mpg ~ am, mtcars)
result.0 <- summary(model.0)
```

The Adjusted R-squared = `r result.0$adj.r.squared`. It shows that the model only able to explain 34% of the variance. 

So, we have to include other variable to our model by using R step() function.

```{r}
best.model <- step(lm(mpg ~ ., data = mtcars), trace=0)
result.1 <- summary(best.model)
result.1
```

The Adjusted R-squared = `r result.1$adj.r.squared` shows that 83% of the variance of the MPG variable. Which mean the variable _wt, qsec and am_ have a correlation affect on _mpg_.

## Summary

Based on the Coefficients table for _best.model_ and looking at categorical variables ***am1***, we can assumed that the manual transmission is `r coef(result.1)[4]` mpg better than automatic transmission.
